## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to analyze data collected from traditional birth attendants across Nigeria. The data encompasses responses from 203 maternity homes, each of which answered a set of 6 open-ended questions.

## Methodology

### Data Collection

The data was gathered through surveys conducted with traditional birth attendants across various maternity homes in Nigeria. These surveys aimed to capture detailed and qualitative insights into maternal health outcomes.

### Data Cleaning and Structuring

Given the open-ended nature of the survey responses, rigorous data cleaning and structuring efforts were essential. This process involved:

1. **Removing Duplicates**: Ensuring that each response is unique and free from repetitions.
2. **Handling Missing Data**: Addressing incomplete responses to maintain data integrity.
3. **Standardizing Formats**: Ensuring consistency in the data format for better analysis.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP) Techniques

To extract meaningful insights from the raw responses, classic NLP techniques were employed:

1. **Tokenization**: Breaking down text into individual words or phrases.
2. **Stop Words Removal**: Eliminating common words that do not contribute significant meaning.
3. **Stemming and Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their base or root forms.
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining the sentiment expressed in the responses.
5. **Topic Modeling**: Identifying common themes and topics within the data.

## Insights and Findings

The application of these techniques led to the extraction of valuable insights regarding maternal health outcomes. These findings are intended to inform policies and interventions aimed at improving maternal health services in Nigeria.
