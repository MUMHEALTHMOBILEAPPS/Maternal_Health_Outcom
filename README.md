The main objective of the project is to analyse the data obtained by surveying the tradition birth attendants across Nigeria. The data spans 203 maternity homes and each have been asked a set of 6 questions with open ended responses. 

The project applies rigorous data cleaning and structuring efforts alongside classic NLP techniques to draw some interesting insights from the raw responses
